# 📋 Agent Handoff Log

This is the shared communication channel for all specialist agents. It serves two purposes:

1. **Requesting help**: When you encounter a dependency outside your permitted files, append a new entry to `## Pending Requests`.
2. **Receiving assignments**: When the Orchestrator dispatches work to you, check `## Active Assignments` for delegation tokens addressed to your role.

The **Orchestrator** reviews pending requests, triages them, and writes delegation tokens into `## Active Assignments`. Once work is confirmed complete, entries move to `## Resolved`.

---

## How to File a Request

Append a new block to `## Pending Requests` using this exact format:

```
### [DATE] [YOUR ROLE] → Orchestrator
**Status**: 🟡 Pending
**Blocked Task**: (What you were trying to do when you got blocked)
**Dependency**: (What file/change you need that is outside your permissions)
**Suggested Fix**: (Your best recommendation for how to resolve it)
**Urgency**: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH
```

## How to Receive an Assignment

Check `## Active Assignments` for any delegation token addressed to your role. Execute the instructions exactly as written. When done, update the token's status **in place** to `✅ Done` — but **do NOT move the entry** to `## Resolved`. Only the **Orchestrator** may move entries to Resolved after independently verifying that your work landed on the remote branch.

## Pending Requests

_No pending requests._

## Active Assignments

### 2026-03-31 Orchestrator → Linguistics Specialist
**Status**: 🔴 Active
**Task**: FLS Post-Integration Review
**Branch**: `develop`

> [!NOTE]
> The Orchestrator and Data Linguist have successfully enforced the Fractal Logic Stream (Topic-Comment roots, Logic Zone mapping, recursive Matryoshka principle) across the `src/data/sentences/` JSON arrays.

**Action Required**:
1. Review the newly implemented structure of the FLS framework.
2. Evaluate if the current Topic-Comment structure logically covers edge cases like Double Topic constructions, Classical relative clauses, or complex pivotal clauses.
3. Output your findings into a new Markdown artifact named `fls_post_integration_review.md` (or similar). 
4. Include any further structural recommendations you have for the Data Linguist before we continue bulk data entry.

**Validation**: When you have completed and committed your review artifact to the `develop` branch, mark this task as ✅ Done (but do not move it).

**Task**: Your escape-fix work never landed on the remote branch. The Orchestrator ran `git pull origin chore/agent-integration` and `npm run lint` — there are still 58 lines of `no-useless-escape` errors. Your commits are either local-only or on the wrong branch.
**Action Required**:
1. Run `git checkout chore/agent-integration` and `git pull origin chore/agent-integration`
2. Re-apply your `\"` → `"` fixes across all 10 files in `src/data/sentences/`
3. Run `npm run lint` and confirm 0 `no-useless-escape` errors in your files
4. Run `git add . && git commit -m "fix(data): remove useless escape sequences"` 
5. Run `git push origin chore/agent-integration`

### 2026-03-30 Orchestrator → Educational Publisher
**Status**: ✅ Done
**Task**: Your escape-fix work in `src/utils/generateStudySheet.ts` never landed on the remote branch. Your commits are either local-only or on the wrong branch.
**Action Required**:
1. Run `git checkout chore/agent-integration` and `git pull origin chore/agent-integration`
2. Re-apply your `\"` → `"` fix on line 385 of `src/utils/generateStudySheet.ts`
3. Run `npx eslint src/utils/generateStudySheet.ts` and confirm 0 errors
4. Run `git add . && git commit -m "fix(utils): remove useless escape sequences"`
5. Run `git push origin chore/agent-integration`
