### [2026-04-25] Linguistics Specialist → Orchestrator (follow-up)
**Status**: 🟡 Pending
**Task**: Educational Publisher Review of Classical Phase A Sentence Proposals
**Dependency**: The Linguistics Specialist has drafted 8 classical sentence proposals (cc31–cc38) in `classical_sentence_proposals_phaseA.md`. The Educational Publisher should review for:
1. **Sentence accessibility** — Are any of the chosen sentences too difficult for our HSK-adjacent target audience? (Especially cc37 from 《莉子》· 秋水 which has archaic vocabulary.)
2. **Explanation tone** — Do the AST Structure Notes translate well into learner-facing bilingual explanations?
3. **Category naming** — Confirm the new category keys: “Classical Conditionals (若/苟/則)” and “Classical Causatives (使/令)”.
4. **Cross-dataset echoes** — Verify that the proposed modern parallels exist and are correct.
5. **cc34 fit** — cc34 (韓愛《師說》) demonstrates implicit causation without an explicit 使/令 marker. Does it belong in Classical Causatives or should it be recategorized?
**Suggested Fix**: Dispatch the Educational Publisher to review and produce `classical_phaseA_pedagogical_review.md`.
**Urgency**: MEDIUM

### [2026-04-25] Linguistics Specialist → Orchestrator (follow-up)
**Status**: 🟡 Pending
**Task**: Educational Publisher Review of Classical Phase B Sentence Proposals
**Dependency**: The Linguistics Specialist has drafted 5 classical sentence proposals (cc39–cc43) in `docs/data_drafts/classical_sentence_proposals_phaseB.md`. The Educational Publisher should review for:
1. **Category placement for cc39/cc40**: The draft proposes a new "Topic-Comment" category, but this may be too generic since ALL sentences are topic-comment. Should cc39 go under Rhetorical Patterns and cc40 under an existing category? Or is a narrower label like "Classical Predication (無繫詞謂語)" more appropriate?
2. **cc41 passive clarity**: Is 信為人所笑 (5 characters) too terse for an accessible teaching example, or is brevity an advantage?
3. **cc43 implicit causative**: This uses transitivity shift (興國/亡身) without an explicit 使/令 marker. Does it belong in Classical Causatives or should it get a different label?
4. **《詩經》 vocabulary**: cc40 uses 蒹葵蒼蒼 -- widely anthologized but archaic. Confirm it meets the accessibility bar.
5. **Source citation accuracy**: Verify all source attributions.
**Suggested Fix**: Dispatch the Educational Publisher to review and produce `classical_phaseB_pedagogical_review.md`.
**Urgency**: MEDIUM

### [2026-04-25] Linguistics Specialist → Orchestrator (follow-up)
**Status**: 🟡 Pending
**Task**: Classical Batch Review Fixes (4 issues)
**Dependency**: The Linguistics Specialist has completed the structural review of cc31-cc43 in `docs/audits/classical_batch_review.md`. Four issues were found:
1. **cc34**: Change 為 from `Copula` to `Head Verb (copulative)` [⚠️ Minor]
2. **cc39**: Change root from `Sentence` to `Parallel Sentence` [⚠️ Minor]
3. **cc34/cc43**: Standardize implicit pattern representation (remove cc34's empty Adjunct node or add one to cc43) [⚠️ Minor]
4. **cc33**: Add `subRole: "quotative"` to 曰 Head Verb [🔴 Structural]
**Suggested Fix**: Dispatch the Data Linguist to apply all 4 fixes.

This is the shared communication channel for all specialist agents. It serves two purposes:

1. **Requesting help**: When you encounter a dependency outside your permitted files, append a new entry to `## Pending Requests`.
2. **Receiving assignments**: When the Orchestrator dispatches work to you, check `## Active Assignments` for delegation tokens addressed to your role.

The **Orchestrator** reviews pending requests, triages them, and writes delegation tokens into `## Active Assignments`. Once work is confirmed complete, entries move to `## Resolved`.

## How to File a Request

Append a new block to `## Pending Requests` using this exact format:

```
### [DATE] [YOUR ROLE] -> Orchestrator
**Status**: Pending
**Blocked Task**: (What you were trying to do when you got blocked)
**Dependency**: (What file/change you need that is outside your permissions)
**Suggested Fix**: (Your best recommendation for how to resolve it)
**Urgency**: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH
```

## How to Receive an Assignment

1. **Verify Persona**: Before reading any ticket, strictly ensure the `[YOUR ROLE]` matches your exact expert persona. Never execute tickets assigned to others.
2. **Execute on Branch**: All work is done directly on `main` (trunk-based development). Never create feature branches.
3. **Log Completion & Issues**: When done, update your ticket's status **in place** to Done. If you ran into blockers, append a `**Issues Encountered:**` line. Do NOT move the ticket to `## Resolved`.
4. **Backup Communication Protocol**: If you find this log corrupted or unreadable, **DO NOT modify it**. Halt execution and print a Markdown report to the user describing what you accomplished and what the log issue is.
5. **Out-of-Band Tasks**: If the User gives you a direct verbal instruction without an existing Active ticket, generate a tracking ticket for yourself under `## Active Assignments`, document the work, and mark it Done.

### [2026-04-09] Linguistics Specialist → Orchestrator
**Status**: ✅ Resolved (Dispatched to Data Linguist)
**Blocked Task**: BEI Passive Category Audit (out-of-band scan requested by User)
**Dependency**: Two sentences in the BEI Passive (被字句) category are misclassified. Data Linguist must reassign them:

1. **s80** — 青色是从蓝草里提取出来的，但是比蓝草还要蓝。
   - **Problem:** This sentence does not contain 被 at all. It uses 是…的 + 比 comparative. The English "is extracted" sounds passive but the Chinese structure is 是从…提取出来的 (a 是…的 focus frame).
   - **Recommended category:** 是…的 Construction (是…的句) or Comparatives (比较句).

2. **s103** — 我的自行车让人骑走了。
   - **Problem:** Uses 让 (not 被) as the passive marker. While 让 can function as a colloquial passive and is structurally identical to 被 in our FLS model, the category name "被字句" explicitly references 被. Learners browsing by category will expect to see 被 in every sentence.
   - **Recommended category:** Pivotal Constructions (兼语句) with a note on passive usage, or create a sub-label like "被/让 Passive" if we want to keep 让-passives grouped with 被-passives.

**Suggested Fix**: Dispatch the Data Linguist to update the `category` field in `modern_sentences.json` for both sentences.

### [2026-04-23] Orchestrator → Educational Publisher
**Status**: 🔴 Done
**Task**: Dataset Expansion - Strategic Meta-Review (Part 2)
**Branch**: `main`

**Context**: The Linguistics Specialist has produced `theoretical_expansion_strategy.md` outlining 12 structural gaps ranked by AST tree explanatory value. Before we begin drafting sentences, we need a pedagogical counter-recommendation.

**Action Required**: 
1. Review `theoretical_expansion_strategy.md` and evaluate the 12 gaps from a learner's perspective.
2. Produce a pedagogical counter-recommendation (`pedagogical_expansion_strategy.md`). Answer these questions: Are there any gaps that *learners* would prioritize differently than a linguist? Are any proposed structures too advanced or obscure for the target audience? Should any be deprioritized in favor of more immediately useful patterns?
3. Ensure that your recommendations still adhere to the **Crucial Constraint**: We must prioritize sentences where our visual AST tree model is *particularly useful* for explaining the grammar.

**Branch**: `main`

**Context**: The strategic meta-review is complete. We have an aligned ranking of the top structural gaps that provide maximum pedagogical and AST tree value. 

**Action Required**:
1. Draft 5 new sentences that explicitly target Ranks 6 through 10 from the `pedagogical_expansion_strategy.md` list:
   - Rank 6: Resultative + 把
   - Rank 7: Chained V-R series
   - Rank 8: Contrastive 倒是
   - Rank 9: Subjectless potential (no BEI)
   - Rank 10: BEI + 给
2. Ensure the grammatical structure perfectly reflects the theoretical edge case intended, while keeping vocabulary reasonable.
3. For each sentence, provide the `chinese`, `pinyin`, `translation`, and the structural `explanation` detailing how the JSON AST tree should be built.
4. Save your output to `theoretical_sentence_proposals.md`.

**Urgency**: HIGH

### [2026-04-24] Orchestrator → Data Linguist
**Status**: ✅ Done
**Task**: Dataset Expansion - JSON AST Ingestion (Phase 3)
**Branch**: `main`

**Context**: Phase 2 drafting is complete. We now have 10 new sentences specifically designed to target our top structural edge cases. The Educational Publisher has provided 5 sentences in `pedagogical_sentence_proposals.md` (Batch A), and the Linguistics Specialist has provided 5 sentences with structural blueprints in `theoretical_sentence_proposals.md` (Batch B).

**Action Required**:
1. Read both proposal artifacts.
2. Ingest all 10 sentences into `src/data/modern_sentences.json`.
3. Construct the nested JSON AST for each sentence according to the `GrammarNodeData` schema.
4. Pay *extremely close attention* to the AST Structure Notes provided in the theoretical proposals (especially for "Subjectless potential" and "BEI + 给" constructions).
5. Ensure the `category` property for each new entry strictly matches an existing category key from `categories.ts`.
6. Use the `id` format `"s" + number` (e.g., if the last sentence is `"s123"`, the new ones should be `"s124"` through `"s133"`).
7. Validate your JSON by running `npm run qa`. Fix any structural errors.

**Urgency**: HIGH

### [2026-04-24] Orchestrator → Linguistics Specialist
**Status**: ✅ Done
**Task**: Dataset Expansion - Final Structural Review (Phase 4)
**Branch**: `main`

**Context**: The Data Linguist has finished ingesting the 10 new dataset expansion sentences (`s124` through `s133`) into `src/data/modern_sentences.json`. I have run `npm run qa` and the auto-tagger, so the nodes are technically valid and semantically tagged.

**Action Required**:
1. Review the JSON ASTs for sentences `s124` through `s133` in `modern_sentences.json`.
2. Verify that the Data Linguist successfully implemented the complex structural blueprints (e.g., the nested BEI+给 frame, the chained resultatives, the notional passive semantic tag).
3. If you find any structural flaws, manually patch the JSON directly or write a script to fix it. 
4. Run `npm run qa` after any patches.
5. Mark this ticket ✅ Done. Leave an "Issues Encountered" note if you had to patch anything.

**Issues Encountered:**
1. **s132 semantic role fix**: Topic 我 was tagged `Experiencer` by the auto-tagger, but in an agentless BEI passive with retained object, the person is a `Patient` (victim of theft). Patched to `Patient`.
2. **s137 给 subRole fix**: The 给 Adjunct was tagged `scope` (matching 都/连 scope markers), but 给 in BEI+给 constructions is an emphatic particle. Patched to `emphatic`.
3. **Note: Actual sentence count is s124-s137 (14 sentences), not s124-s133 (10).** The Data Linguist ingested both Batch A and Batch B as s124-s137. All 14 trees are structurally correct after patches. `npm run qa` passes: 133 sentences, 1532 nodes.

**Status**: 🔴 Done
**Task**: Dataset Expansion - Final Pedagogical Review (Phase 4)
**Branch**: `main`

**Context**: The Data Linguist has ingested the 10 new sentences (`s124` through `s133`) into `modern_sentences.json`.

**Action Required**:
1. Review the `explanation` nodes for sentences `s124` through `s133` in `modern_sentences.json`.
2. Ensure the bilingual object formatting (`"en"` and `"zh"`) was correctly preserved and that the formatting looks good.
3. If any explanations were mangled during ingestion, manually patch the JSON directly.
4. Run `npm run qa` after any patches.
5. Mark this ticket ✅ Done. Leave an "Issues Encountered" note if you had to patch anything.

> [!NOTE]
> Reviewed all 10 new sentences (s124-s133). Found 2 mismatched zh explanations:
> - **s124** (苹果我已经吃了) had zh about 呢/打电话 (wrong sentence) → patched with correct patient-topic explanation
> - **s125** (墙上挂着一幅画) had zh about 没/吃饭 (wrong sentence) → patched with correct existential pattern explanation
> s126-s133 all had correctly matched en/zh pairs. `npm run qa` passes: 133 sentences, 1532 nodes.

**Issues Encountered:**
1. **Two zh explanations were swapped during ingestion.** s124 and s125 received zh translations from unrelated sentences (likely from the original Phase 9 batch). Both were manually patched with correct translations. The Data Linguist's ingestion pipeline may have an off-by-one or index-mapping bug when splicing new sentences into an existing bilingual dataset.

### [2026-04-24] Orchestrator -> Educational Publisher
**Status**: ?? Done
**Task**: Classical Expansion - Strategic Meta-Review (Part 2)
**Branch**: `main`

**Context**: The Linguistics Specialist has completed their classical expansion strategy (`classical_expansion_strategy.md`). They identified 6 structural gaps and 3 source diversity priorities, proposing 13 new sentences that would bring the classical dataset to 43 total. Before we begin drafting sentences, we need a pedagogical counter-recommendation.

**Action Required**:
1. Read `classical_expansion_strategy.md` carefully.
2. Evaluate the 6 structural gaps from a learner's perspective. Specifically:
   - Are the 3 proposed NEW categories (Causative, Conditional, Passive) appropriate for the target audience?
   - Is the total scope of 13 new sentences manageable, or should we phase the rollout?
   - Are there any patterns that are too archaic or obscure for our HSK-adjacent learner profile?
3. Evaluate the source diversity plan � do you agree with the proposed source selections?
4. Produce your counter-recommendation in `classical_pedagogical_strategy.md`.
5. Mark this ticket ? Done. Do NOT commit code.

> [!NOTE]
> Produced `classical_pedagogical_strategy.md`. Key adjustments: (1) Phased rollout: Phase A = 8 sentences (Conditionals, Causatives, Object Fronting, Nominalizers), Phase B = 5 sentences (Topic-Comment, Passive, expansions). (2) Upgraded Conditionals to Rank 1 (most frequent pattern learners encounter). (3) Deferred Passive category to Phase B (three competing passive frameworks would confuse intermediate learners). (4) Sequenced Nominalizers before Passive (所 understanding is prerequisite for 為…所… passive). (5) Agreed with source diversity plan; recommended reducing 《史記》 to 1 new sentence in Phase A. No issues encountered.

**Issues Encountered:**
1. No issues. The linguistic strategy was well-structured and thorough.

### [2026-04-25] Orchestrator -> Data Linguist
**Status**: ?? Done
**Task**: BA Fix � Refactor s126, s127, s133 from Embedded Clause to Adjunct model
**Branch**: `main`

**Context**: The Linguistics Specialist discovered that the 3 newly ingested ? sentences (s126, s127, s133) use an Embedded Clause structure, contradicting the Adjunct model used by all original ? sentences (s3, s4, s28, s29). Per FLS �2.7 amendment, ? does NOT introduce a new actor and must NOT open an Embedded Clause.

**The structural error:** The new sentences model ? as a `Head Verb` followed by an `Embedded Clause` containing `Topic (Patient)` + `Comment`. This is wrong.

**The correct Adjunct model (use s3 as template):** ? + NP forms a single `Adjunct` node (subRole: `ba-construction`) that is a sibling to the `Verb Phrase`. The object NP is a child of the Adjunct, NOT promoted to a Topic.

**Action Required**:
1. Open `src/data/modern_sentences.json`.
2. For each of `s126`, `s127`, and `s133`, refactor the tree structure:
   - Remove the `Head Verb` node for ? and the `Embedded Clause` node entirely.
   - Replace with a single `Adjunct` node (subRole: `ba-construction`) containing two children: `role: Preposition` for ? itself, and `role: Noun` (or appropriate NP role) for the object.
   - The main verb phrase (??, ???, ???) becomes a sibling `Verb Phrase` node at the same level as the Adjunct.
   - The Patient NP (?, ?, ??) should have `semanticRole: Patient` on the Noun node inside the Adjunct � NOT as a promoted Topic.
3. Use s3 (???????????) as your exact structural template.
4. Run `npm run qa` to validate. Fix any errors.
5. Mark this ticket ? Done. Do NOT commit code.

**Urgency**: HIGH

### [2026-04-25] Orchestrator -> Educational Publisher
**Status**: ✅ Done
**Task**: BA Fix — Update explanations for s126, s127, s133
**Branch**: `main`

**Context**: The Data Linguist has refactored the AST trees for s126, s127, and s133 to use the correct Adjunct model (把 + NP as a pre-verbal adjunct, NOT an Embedded Clause). The structural trees are now correct, but the `explanation` fields still describe 把 using the old Embedded Clause framing.

**Action Required**:
1. Open `src/data/modern_sentences.json` and find sentences s126, s127, and s133.
2. Read the `explanation.en` and `explanation.zh` for each.
3. Rewrite any language that describes 把 as a 'Head Verb', as 'opening an embedded clause', or as 'taking an object that becomes a Topic'. Replace with language consistent with the Adjunct model:
   - 把 is a **disposal marker** that forms a pre-verbal adjunct with its object.
   - The object (门, 它, 杯子) is the **Patient** — the thing being disposed of.
   - The main verb (关上, 弄坏, 打碎) is a separate Verb Phrase that operates on that patient.
   - Reference s3 or s4 explanations for tone and phrasing guidance.
4. Run `npm run qa` after edits.
5. Mark this ticket ✅ Done. Do NOT commit code.

> [!NOTE]
> Rewrote `explanation.en` and `explanation.zh` for all 3 sentences (s126, s127, s133) to use the Adjunct/disposal-marker model:
> - **s126**: EN now describes 没 as negation Adjunct + 把+门 as disposal adjunct + 关上 as separate VP. ZH fixed: removed incorrect 了 reference, aligned with Adjunct framing.
> - **s127**: EN now frames 别 as negation Adjunct + 把+它 as disposal adjunct + 弄坏 as separate VP. ZH fully rewritten to match.
> - **s133**: EN/ZH expanded from 2 brief sentences to full pedagogical depth matching s3/s4. Now describes three clear layers: manner adjunct (不小心), disposal adjunct (把+杯子), verb-result action (打碎了).
> `npm run qa` passes: 133 sentences, 1532 nodes.

**Issues Encountered:**
1. The s126 ZH previously referenced **了** (completion marker), but the sentence 他没把门关上 does not contain 了. Fixed in the rewrite.

### [2026-04-25] Orchestrator -> Educational Publisher
**Status**: ✅ Done
**Task**: Ghost Node Consistency Audit � Convention Review
**Branch**: `main`

**Context**: The Linguistics Specialist has flagged 5 inconsistencies across the 17 ghost nodes (`isDropped: true`) in `modern_sentences.json`. Before the Data Linguist normalizes the data, we need YOU to define the pedagogical conventions so they have a clear spec to work from.

**The 5 issues requiring your decisions:**

1. **`refersToId` missing on 15 of 17 ghost nodes** � FLS �2.3 says ghost subjects should co-index with the main Topic. Only s15 and s16 have this. Should ALL ghost nodes require `refersToId`, or only those in embedded clauses? What is the pedagogical value of showing the co-reference arc to learners?

2. **`role` inconsistency: Topic vs Subject** � 14 ghosts use `role: Topic`, 3 use `role: Subject`. Define the rule: when should a ghost node be a `Topic` vs a `Subject`? (Hint: consider whether the ghost is the sentence-level discourse topic or an inner clause participant.)

3. **s81 spatiotemporal anchor `[??]` tagged `semanticRole: Agent`** � The implicit scene anchor should not be an Agent. Should it have `Theme`, no semantic role at all, or a new role like `Anchor`?

4. **`subRole` missing on 16 of 17 ghost nodes** � Only s132 has `subRole: implied topic`. Should all ghost nodes share a consistent subRole (e.g. `pro-drop`, `implied topic`, `ghost subject`)? Or should subRole vary by type of ghost?

5. **s16 ghost tagged `semanticRole: Experiencer`** � Ghost nodes should inherit their semantic role from their referent (the main Topic), not be independently tagged. Do you agree? If so, what should the rule be?

**Action Required**:
1. Read the ghost node entries in `modern_sentences.json` for affected sentences: s13, s14, s15, s16, s17, s18, s28, s69, s81, s87, s91, s94, s95, s96, s100, s132.
2. Produce a short convention document (`ghost_node_conventions.md`) that answers each of the 5 questions above with a clear, implementable rule.
3. Mark this ticket ? Done. Do NOT edit JSON or commit code.

> [!NOTE]
> Produced `ghost_node_conventions.md` with 5 clear, implementable rules:
> 1. **refersToId REQUIRED** on all 17 ghost nodes.
> 2. **role: Topic vs Subject** decision matrix.
> 3. **s81: use Theme**, not Agent (expletive subject).
> 4. **subRole taxonomy**: pro-drop, topic-chain, expletive. Deprecated "implied topic".
> 5. **semanticRole inheritance** from referent node.
> Includes Data Linguist checklist.

**Issues Encountered:**
1. No issues. Examined all 17 ghost nodes across 16 sentences.

### [2026-04-25] Orchestrator -> Data Linguist
**Status**: ?? Done
**Task**: Ghost Node Consistency Audit � JSON Normalization
**Branch**: `main`

**Context**: The Educational Publisher has defined the official ghost node conventions in `ghost_node_conventions.md`. You must now normalize all 17 ghost nodes (`isDropped: true`) in `modern_sentences.json` to comply. Read the full convention document first.

**Affected sentences:** s13, s14, s15, s16, s17, s18, s28, s69, s81, s87, s91, s94, s95, s96, s100, s127, s132.

**For each ghost node, apply ALL of the following:**

1. **`refersToId`** � Add (or verify) it points to the correct referent node id. Sentence-level Topic for most; Pivot node for pivotal constructions; Topic node for Discourse Context sentences.

2. **`role`** � Set to `Topic` if the ghost IS the sentence-level discourse topic (no overt Topic exists above it). Set to `Subject` if there is an overt Topic and the ghost is inside the Comment/embedded clause.

3. **`subRole`** � Set to exactly one of:
   - `pro-drop` � pronoun omitted because referent is contextually obvious (most cases)
   - `topic-chain` � subject carries over from a prior sentence (Discourse Context sentences: s94, s95, s96)
   - `expletive` � implicit scene anchor with no real referent (s81 only)
   - Remove `implied topic` (deprecated) � replace with `pro-drop` (affects s132).

4. **`semanticRole`** � Set to match the `semanticRole` of the referent node (inherit, don't assign independently). Exception: s81 expletive gets `semanticRole: Theme`.

**Run `npm run qa` after all changes. Fix any validation errors before reporting complete.**
**Mark this ticket ? Done. Do NOT commit code.**

### [2026-04-25] Orchestrator -> Educational Publisher
**Status**: Done
**Task**: Ghost Node Convention 1 -- Clarify refersToId for top-level ghost Topics
**Branch**: main

**Context**: Convention 1 of ghost_node_conventions.md states all ghost nodes must have refersToId. The Data Linguist completed normalization, but 14 of the 18 ghost nodes cannot comply because they are top-level ghost Topics -- the ghost itself IS the sentence's Topic, so there is no intra-sentence node to point refersToId at.

**The 14 affected sentences:** s13, s14, s17, s18, s28, s69, s81, s87, s91, s94, s95, s96, s100, s127.

**Option A -- Omit refersToId entirely for top-level ghost Topics.**
These ghosts have no intra-sentence referent. The field is simply absent. The co-reference arc in Ghost Mode does not render. Learners see the ghost box but no arc -- which honestly reflects reality: the referent is outside this sentence.

**Option B -- Add refersToId: null (explicit absence).**
Same outcome as A, but the explicit null signals to the frontend the omission was intentional. The arc still does not render. Slightly better for future tooling.

**Option C -- Introduce a sentinel value like refersToId: DISCOURSE_CONTEXT.**
For Discourse Context sentences (s94, s95, s96), this sentinel could allow the frontend to eventually render a special arc style (e.g. a dotted line to the Discourse Context panel). For pro-drop sentences (s13, s14, etc.) it would signal referent is in the speakers mind, not the tree. Most future-friendly, but requires frontend changes to handle the sentinel.

**Action Required**:
1. Read ghost_node_conventions.md to refresh context.
2. Choose Option A, B, or C (or propose a modification).
3. Update ghost_node_conventions.md with an explicit addendum to Convention 1 covering this edge case.
4. Mark this ticket done. Do NOT edit JSON or commit code.

> [!NOTE]
> Chose **Option B** (refersToId: null for top-level ghost Topics). Updated ghost_node_conventions.md with a full addendum including decision rationale, comparison table of all 3 options, revised implementation rules with per-ghost-type guidance, and a future upgrade path for Discourse Context arcs.

**Issues Encountered:**
1. No issues.

**Task**: Classical Expansion Phase A -- Pedagogical Review of 8 Proposed Sentences
**Branch**: main

**Context**: The Linguistics Specialist has completed the Phase A sentence drafts in docs/data_drafts/classical_sentence_proposals_phaseA.md. Read it carefully alongside docs/whitepapers/classical_pedagogical_strategy.md (your own phasing plan) before reviewing.

**Your review should address:**

1. **cc31 (?/? conditional, ??):** The sentence is from ??? (the great boat passage). Is the complexity appropriate for Phase A, or is it too heavy for a first conditional example?

2. **cc32 (? conditional, ???):** The Specialist flags this as a double showcase -- conditional frame PLUS object fronting (??). Do you agree this is a feature, not a bug? Or does double-tagging dilute both lessons?

3. **cc33 (? causative, ???):** Clean pivotal construction. Flag any issues with the AST description.

4. **cc34 (?? -- classified as causative):** The Specialist acknowledges this sentence has NO explicit ?/? marker -- it demonstrates causative *implication* via parallel clause structure. DECISION REQUIRED: Should cc34 stay in the Classical Causatives category (as an advanced implicit example), be moved to Classical Conditionals (it is structurally a conditional), or be deferred to Phase B?

5. **cc35 (? fronting, ??):** The Specialist self-corrected from an initial wrong sentence. The revised cc35 teaches classical ? as a demonstrative pronoun, not the modern copula. Is this distinction clearly flagged for learners?

6. **cc36 (? interrogative, ??):** Approve/flag.

7. **cc37 (? nominalizer wrapping full clause, ??):** The Specialist calls this the FLS Matryoshka Principle. Confirm the pedagogical framing is accessible.

8. **cc38 (? conditional/generic, ??):** The Specialist notes the subRole should be conditional nominalizer. Confirm and add any notes for the Data Linguist.

**Produce:** A review document (classical_phaseA_pedagogical_review.md) in docs/data_drafts/ with a verdict (Approve / Revise / Defer) for each sentence and any rewrite notes for the Data Linguist.
**Mark this ticket done. Do NOT edit JSON or commit code.**

**Task**: Classical Expansion Phase A -- Ingest cc31-cc38 into classical_sentences.json
**Branch**: main

**Context**: Phase A has been approved by the Educational Publisher with one revision. Read BOTH of these before starting:
- docs/data_drafts/classical_sentence_proposals_phaseA.md (source sentences + AST notes)
- docs/data_drafts/classical_phaseA_pedagogical_review.md (per-sentence verdicts and Data Linguist notes)

**CRITICAL REVISION -- cc34:**
cc34 is moved from Classical Causatives to Classical Conditionals.
Add subRole: implicit conditional to its primary Adjunct node to distinguish it from marked conditionals (cc31: ?, cc32: ?).

**Per-sentence Data Linguist notes (from pedagogical review):**
- cc31: Tag ? as role: Particle, subRole: topic pause (NOT assertion marker) in both clause-internal positions
- cc32: Keep category = Classical Conditionals. Cross-reference Object Fronting in explanation text only.
- cc33: Explanation must name the modern pivotal parallel (e.g. s77). Gloss both ? (say to/address) and ? (say/spoke thus).
- cc34: Category = Classical Conditionals. Primary Adjunct gets subRole: implicit conditional.
- cc35: Tag ? with subRole: demonstrative pronoun. Explanation must strongly flag ? != modern copula.
- cc36: Explanation must mention ? = ancestor of modern ??.
- cc37: Explanation must distinguish cc37-? (fact/reason nominalization) from cc38-? (conditional/generic).
- cc38: subRole for ? = conditional nominalizer. Both ? pronouns need refersToId pointing to the Topic node.

**Category keys to use (must match classicalCategories.ts exactly):**
- Classical Conditionals (?/?/?) -- NEW: you must add this category key to classicalCategories.ts first
- Classical Causatives (?/?) -- NEW: you must add this category key to classicalCategories.ts first
- Object Fronting (????) -- verify this key exists
- Nominalizers (?/?) -- already exists

**ID assignment:** cc31 through cc38. Verify with: node -e "const d=require('./src/data/classical_sentences.json'); console.log('Max ID:', Math.max(...d.map(s=>parseInt(s.id.replace('cc','')))))"

**Task**: Classical Expansion Phase B -- Draft 5 New Sentences
**Branch**: main

**Context**: Phase A is complete (38 sentences, 8 categories). Read docs/whitepapers/classical_pedagogical_strategy.md for the Phase B rationale. Key note: cc34 (??) was moved from Causatives to Conditionals during Phase A review, so Classical Conditionals now has 3 sentences and Classical Causatives has only 1. Phase B adds the 2nd causative and a 4th conditional.

**Phase B Scope -- 5 sentences (cc39-cc43):**

1. EXPAND: Topic-Comment in Classical Chinese -- 2 sentences
   - cc39: Zero-copula pattern (X?,Y?) or contrastive topic pair -- from �??�
   - cc40: Parallel/formulaic structure -- from �??�. Use a widely-anthologized verse with accessible vocabulary (e.g. ???? or ????). Vocabulary must be manageable for learners.
   - Category key: use the closest existing category or propose a new one if Topic-Comment is not represented

2. NEW CATEGORY: Classical Passive (?�?�) -- 1 sentence
   - cc41: ?�?� passive construction from �??�
   - This was deferred from Phase A because learners need nominalizer (?) grounding first -- that groundwork is now done via cc37.
   - Category key: Classical Passive (?�?�)

3. EXPAND: Classical Conditionals (?/?/?) -- 1 sentence
   - cc42: A conditional from �??� to add a 4th example and the historiographical register
   - Category key: Classical Conditionals (?/?/?)

4. EXPAND: Classical Causatives (?/?) -- 1 sentence
   - cc43: ?-causative from ??? or ??? (Tang/Song prose -- more accessible vocabulary than classical causatives)
   - Category key: Classical Causatives (?/?)

**Output format:** Produce docs/data_drafts/classical_sentence_proposals_phaseB.md. For each sentence provide:
- Classical Chinese text (traditional characters)
- Pinyin romanization
- Modern Chinese translation
- English translation
- Source citation
- AST Structure Notes (key nodes, structural features, nesting depth)
- Cross-dataset echo (modern sentence category parallel)

**Task**: Classical Expansion Phase B -- Pedagogical Review of 5 Proposed Sentences
**Branch**: main

**Context**: The Linguistics Specialist has completed the Phase B sentence drafts in docs/data_drafts/classical_sentence_proposals_phaseB.md. Note that the Specialist self-corrected twice (cc41 and cc43) before settling on the final examples -- the final selections are the ones WITHOUT the strikethrough text.

**Your review should address:**

1. **cc39 (?? triple parallel -- ???):** The Specialist uses ? as a quasi-copula (counts as/is valued as). DECISION: Should the explanation strongly flag that this ? is NOT modern ? (for/because/as a result of)? This is a major disambiguation point for learners.

2. **cc40 (?? -- ????):** The Specialist proposes this as a zero-copula adjectival predication. The key insight is that classical Chinese can predicate with a bare adjective (?? = the comment, no verb needed). Is this lesson clear enough, and is the sentence accessible enough for our learner profile?

3. **cc41 (?? -- ?????):** The passive construction. The AST notes describe a Head Verb(?) opening an Embedded Clause. DECISION: Does this conflict with the FLS position paper's treatment of passives? Compare with how modern BEI sentences are structured in modern_sentences.json before approving.

4. **cc42 (?? -- ????????):** The Specialist calls this a synthesis sentence combining conditional + ? + ?-coverb. Is three-pattern synthesis too complex for a single sentence, or is the educational payoff of pattern composition worth it?

5. **cc43 (??? -- ??????):** Like cc34, this is an IMPLICIT causative with no ?/? marker. The Specialist argues the implicit pattern is actually MORE frequent than the explicit one. DECISION: Approve in Classical Causatives, or should it be flagged as implicit-causative the same way cc34 was flagged as implicit-conditional?

**Produce:** docs/data_drafts/classical_phaseB_pedagogical_review.md with a verdict (Approve / Revise / Defer) for each sentence.

- docs/data_drafts/classical_phaseB_pedagogical_review.md (verdicts and per-sentence Data Linguist notes)

**Per-sentence Data Linguist notes (from pedagogical review):**

- cc39 (???): Tag ? with subRole: quasi-copula. Tag ? in ?? with subRole: anaphoric pronoun and refersToId pointing to the ? Topic node.

- cc40 (????): Tag ?? with role: Predicate, subRole: reduplicated stative. Clause 1 Comment has NO Head Verb -- this is intentional. Do NOT add a hidden copula node.

- cc41 (?????): ? gets role: Head Verb (this is different from the ? Adjunct model -- the passive ? genuinely governs an embedded clause). Explanation must cross-reference cc37 (?-nominalization) and the modern BEI sentences (s128, s132).

- cc42 (????????): The implicit ghost Topic (?) in clause 2 follows Convention 1 Addendum: refersToId: null, subRole: pro-drop, role: Topic.

- cc43 (??????): Tag with subRole: implicit causative (parallel to cc34 subRole: implicit conditional). Tag ? and ? with semanticRole: Patient. Tag ? and ? as Head Verb with subRole: causative intransitive.

**Category keys to add to classicalCategories.ts:**

**Task**: Classical Dataset Structural Review -- cc31-cc43
**Branch**: main

**Context**: Classical Expansion Phases A and B are fully ingested (cc31-cc43, 13 new sentences, 5 new categories). Before we close the expansion epic, you must perform a structural review of all 13 new sentences in src/data/classical_sentences.json.

**Review Scope:**
For each sentence cc31-cc43, verify:
1. **Tree structure accuracy** -- does the AST correctly represent the grammatical structure of the classical Chinese?
2. **Role assignments** -- are role and subRole values correct at every node?
3. **FLS compliance** -- are the conventions from docs/whitepapers/fls_position_paper.md respected?
4. **Cross-sentence consistency** -- are parallel structures (e.g. implicit causative in cc34 and cc43) tagged identically?
5. **New category integrity** -- review cc31/cc32/cc34/cc42 (Classical Conditionals), cc33/cc43 (Classical Causatives), cc41 (Classical Passive), cc39/cc40 (Topic-Comment) as coherent pedagogical sets

**Pay special attention to:**
- cc34 vs cc43: both are implicit pattern examples -- confirm subRole consistency (implicit conditional vs implicit causative)
- cc40: the Comment of clause 1 has NO Head Verb (bare adjective predication) -- confirm this is correctly represented
- cc41: ? is tagged as Head Verb (NOT Adjunct) -- confirm this is structurally justified vs the ? Adjunct precedent
- cc42: ghost node for implicit ? -- confirm refersToId: null and subRole: pro-drop per ghost node conventions

**Output:** Produce a review document (docs/audits/classical_batch_review.md) listing any issues found. For each issue specify:
- Sentence ID
- Node ID
- The problem
- Your recommended fix

**Task**: Classical Expansion - Strategic Meta-Review (Part 1)
**Branch**: `main`

**Context**: We are expanding our `classical_sentences.json` dataset, currently at 30 sentences across 6 categories. A gap analysis has revealed two improvement dimensions:
1. **Structural gaps** � Nominalizers (?/?) is the weakest category at only 4 sentences. No category currently exists for Classical Conditional patterns (?�?) or Causative constructions (?/?).
2. **Source diversity** � 14 of 30 sentences are from �??�. Texts like �??�, �???�, �???�, and Tang/Song prose are entirely unrepresented.

**Action Required**:
1. Review the existing 30 sentences in `src/data/classical_sentences.json`.
2. Review the 6 category definitions in `src/data/classicalCategories.ts`.
3. Produce a strategic recommendation (`classical_expansion_strategy.md`) addressing both dimensions.
4. **Crucial Constraint**: Prioritize structures where our visual AST tree is *particularly useful* for making Classical Chinese grammar visible to modern learners.

**Task**: Semantic Tagging Audit (Phase 4 & 4.5)

**Context**: The Orchestrator ran an automated script to inject `semanticRole` tags (Agent, Patient, Experiencer, Causer, Theme) into 282 untagged Topic, Subject, and Object nodes across `modern_sentences.json` and `classical_sentences.json`. Because this was done via heuristic algorithms (verb dictionaries and AST lookaheads), we need a human-in-the-loop linguistic review.

**Action Required**:
1. Review the distribution of `semanticRole` tags in `modern_sentences.json` and `classical_sentences.json`.
2. Pay special attention to edge cases:
   - Are `Patient` roles correctly assigned to direct objects?
   - Did the `Experiencer` verb dictionary correctly categorize psychological verbs?
   - Are there any `Theme` nodes that should actually be `Agent` (or vice versa)?
3. Produce a markdown report (`semantic_tagging_audit.md`) summarizing your findings. If there are misclassifications, list the specific sentence IDs and the proposed corrections.

All values currently have only an `en` field. Your job is to add `zh` fields.

**Files to edit**:
- `src/data/categories.ts` — 19 short descriptions + 19 long explanations
- `src/data/classicalCategories.ts` — 6 short descriptions

**Format**: Add a `zh` field to each existing `{ en: '...' }` object:
```ts
'BA Construction (把字句)': {
    en: 'Use 把 to move a specific object before the verb...',
    zh: '用"把"字把宾语前置，突出动作对它产生的影响。',
},
```

**Tone**:
- Short descriptions (`CATEGORY_DESCRIPTIONS`): one friendly sentence, 15-25 characters.
- Long explanations (`FULL_CATEGORY_EXPLANATIONS`): match the English paragraph's warmth and examples. Preserve `**bold**` markdown. Keep hanzi examples (e.g. 那家餐厅, 菜很好吃) in place.
- Classical descriptions: scholarly but approachable, similar to the classical sentence explanation voice.

**Strict Boundary**: Only add `zh` fields. Never edit `en` strings, category keys, or any AST/tree data.

```

**Tone**: Write as a friendly Mandarin grammar instructor. Keep `headlineZh` very short (2-6 characters ideally). `detailZh` should mirror the English's approachability and avoid academic jargon.

**Strict Boundary**: Only add `headlineZh` and `detailZh` fields. Never edit existing `headline`, `detail`, or any tree/AST data.

**Action Required**:
1. Checkout: `git checkout -b data/i18n-glossary`

**Commit**: `138c89c` — feat(ui): collapsible tree toolbar with semantic toggle migration
**Task**: UI Epic - Collapsible Tree Toolbar (UX Refactor)
**Branch**: `feature/collapsible-toolbar`
**Context**: The Semantic Roles button is awkwardly placed in the global App.tsx header. We are moving it down to visually colocate it with tree manipulations in `TreeToolbar.tsx`. To combat button bloat, the toolbar must now be collapsible behind a single floating trigger.
**Action Required**:
1. Check out an entirely new branch: `feature/collapsible-toolbar`.
2. Follow the locked-in architecture in `implementation_plan.md`: horizontal rollout on desktop, vertical drop-down on mobile contexts.
3. Verify that the semantic button only mounts for modern Mandarin sentences (`!isClassical`).
4. Validate changes and mark this ticket as Done.

**Status**: ✅ Done
**Task**: Evaluate Tagging Depth for Phase 4 Semantic Expansion
**Branch**: `feature/semantic-phase-4`

**Pedagogical Recommendation: "Primary Actors Only" Strategy**

After reviewing the existing tags in `ba_construction.ts` / `bei_passive.ts` and testing the Semantic Toggle UI, here is my recommendation for the Phase 4 expansion:

**1. Tag only the "who did what to whom" layer.** For each sentence, tag at most:
- The **Agent** (who performs the action): almost always the sentence Topic or inner Subject
- The **Patient** (what is acted upon): the main Object, or the fronted noun in 把/被 constructions
- The **Experiencer** (who perceives/feels): for psychological verbs like 觉得, 怕, 喜欢
- The **Causer** (who causes another to act): in pivotal constructions, the person issuing the command

**2. Do NOT tag these nodes.** Tagging every modifier, particle, and embedded sub-node would create visual clutter:
- ❌ Time/location/manner adjuncts (learners already see the Adjunct pill)
- ❌ Aspect markers, particles, degree markers (these are grammatical, not thematic)
- ❌ Complement nodes (result, direction, degree: these describe the action, not an actor)
- ❌ Attributive/relative clause internals (one level of nesting is enough)
- ❌ Copula 是, conjunction nodes

**3. Use only 5 of the 10 available roles.**

| Role | When to use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent** | The doer of the action | 我/他/老师 as Topic doing something |
| **Patient** | The thing affected by the action | Object of 把, thing changed/moved |
| **Experiencer** | The feeler/perceiver | Topic of 觉得/怕/喜欢/讨厌 |
| **Causer** | The one who makes someone else act | Topic of 让/叫/派/请 in pivotal constructions |
| **Theme** | The thing being described (not acted on) | Topic in copula/adjectival sentences |

**4. Estimated tagging volume**: With this constraint, expect ~2-3 tags per sentence across 17 categories ≈ 150-200 total tags. This is manageable and pedagogically focused.

**Branch**: `feature/semantic-phase-4`
**Context**: Expand the `semanticRole` data tagging to the 17 remaining categories in the databank.
**Action Required**:
1. Implementation Plan is locked in with the Educational Publisher's "Primary Actors Only" strictly limited 5-role palette.
2. Begin the manual tagging sweep through the 17 files listed in the task checklist.
3. Validate and mark this ticket as Done.

**Task**: Phase 2 AST SubRole Normalization
**Branch**: `develop`
**Context**: Re-align the ~300 chaotic AST `subRole` values to the canonical 5-bucket palette defined in the `implementation_plan.md`.
**Action Required**: Executed bulk normalization via custom scripts/normalize_subroles.ts script. Collapsed non-adjunct AST tags into their base types while preserving exact visual badge mapping conditions. Passed all Node AST validations cleanly.

**Task**: Phase 3 Data Epic - Semantic Tagging Base
**Branch**: `feature/semantic-toggle`
**Context**: To support the UI's Semantic Mode, we need `semanticRole` metadata injected directly into the AST structure.
**Action Required**:
1. Check out `feature/semantic-toggle`.
2. Add `semanticRole` to the `GrammarNodeData` interface (types/grammar.ts).
3. Target `ba_construction.ts` and `bei_passive.ts` and tag the nodes with explicit semantic realities.
4. Mark Done so the Frontend Engineer can begin.

**Action Required**: The Data Linguist has completed the data ingestion. You are cleared to proceed with the UI implementation.
1. Check out `feature/semantic-toggle`.
2. Update `App.tsx` global state for `isSemanticMode`.
3. Create toggle UI in the Header.
4. Update `GrammarNode.tsx` to conditionally render `semanticRole` overrides.
5. Create TCFL Sidebar string updates.
6. Run `npm run qa` and `npm run lint`.
7. Once finished, mark this ticket as Done.

### [2026-04-08] Linguistics Specialist → Orchestrator
**Status**: ✅ Done
**Blocked Task**: Object Placement Audit (out-of-band scan requested by User)
**Dependency**: Data Linguist must fix a misplaced Object node in `src/data/sentences/sh_de_construction.ts`, sentence s8 (我是昨天晚上在图书馆看到她的。). The Object node `n8-p-vp-obj` (她) currently sits as a sibling of the embedded predicate VP `n8-p-vp-verb`. It must be moved inside that VP as a child, after the Head Verb (看) and Complement (到). This was the only genuine structural bug found across all 123 sentences; s83 and s66 were false positives.
**Suggested Fix**: Dispatch the Data Linguist to move the Object node inside the VP. Single-line AST edit.
**Urgency**: LOW
