# 📋 Agent Handoff Log

This is the shared communication channel for all specialist agents. It serves two purposes:

1. **Requesting help**: When you encounter a dependency outside your permitted files, append a new entry to `## Pending Requests`.
2. **Receiving assignments**: When the Orchestrator dispatches work to you, check `## Active Assignments` for delegation tokens addressed to your role.

The **Orchestrator** reviews pending requests, triages them, and writes delegation tokens into `## Active Assignments`. Once work is confirmed complete, entries move to `## Resolved`.

---

## How to File a Request

Append a new block to `## Pending Requests` using this exact format:

```
### [DATE] [YOUR ROLE] → Orchestrator
**Status**: 🟡 Pending
**Blocked Task**: (What you were trying to do when you got blocked)
**Dependency**: (What file/change you need that is outside your permissions)
**Suggested Fix**: (Your best recommendation for how to resolve it)
**Urgency**: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH
```

## How to Receive an Assignment

Check `## Active Assignments` for any delegation token addressed to your role. Execute the instructions exactly as written. When done, update the token's status **in place** to `✅ Done` — but **do NOT move the entry** to `## Resolved`. Only the **Orchestrator** may move entries to Resolved after independently verifying that your work landed on the remote branch.
