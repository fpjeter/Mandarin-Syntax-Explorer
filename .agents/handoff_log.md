# 📋 Agent Handoff Log

This is the shared communication channel for all specialist agents. It serves two purposes:

1. **Requesting help**: When you encounter a dependency outside your permitted files, append a new entry to `## Pending Requests`.
2. **Receiving assignments**: When the Orchestrator dispatches work to you, check `## Active Assignments` for delegation tokens addressed to your role.

The **Orchestrator** reviews pending requests, triages them, and writes delegation tokens into `## Active Assignments`. Once work is confirmed complete, entries move to `## Resolved`.

---

## How to File a Request

Append a new block to `## Pending Requests` using this exact format:

```
### [DATE] [YOUR ROLE] → Orchestrator
**Status**: 🟡 Pending
**Blocked Task**: (What you were trying to do when you got blocked)
**Dependency**: (What file/change you need that is outside your permissions)
**Suggested Fix**: (Your best recommendation for how to resolve it)
**Urgency**: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH
```

## How to Receive an Assignment

Check `## Active Assignments` for any delegation token addressed to your role. Execute the instructions exactly as written. When done, update the token's status **in place** to `✅ Done` — but **do NOT move the entry** to `## Resolved`. Only the **Orchestrator** may move entries to Resolved after independently verifying that your work landed on the remote branch.

## Pending Requests

_No pending requests._

## Active Assignments

### [DATE] Orchestrator → Linguistics Specialist
**Status**: ✅ Done
**Task**: Define Category Learning Objectives
**Branch**: `develop`

> [!NOTE]
> We are preparing for a massive databank expansion. We need to define exactly what grammatical laws each category must demonstrate.

**Action Required**:
1. Review the list of categories in `src/data/categories.ts`.
2. For each category, explicitly define the mathematical/structural syntactic constraints that sentences inside it MUST demonstrate (e.g., what specific FLS structures must a 'Pivotal Construction' vs. a 'Result Complement' contain?).
3. Output a detailed report to a new artifact named `category_linguistics_demonstrations.md`. 
4. Mark this task as ✅ Done when the artifact is committed.

### [DATE] Orchestrator → Educational Publisher
**Status**: 🔴 Active *(Blocked on Linguistics Specialist)*
**Task**: Curriculum Gap Analysis
**Branch**: `develop`

> [!NOTE]
> The Orchestrator will use your findings to order the Data Linguist to create new sentences.

**Action Required**:
1. Wait for the Linguistics Specialist to output `category_linguistics_demonstrations.md`.
2. Read their structural objectives for each category.
3. Cross-reference those objectives against the *actual* parsed sentences we currently have in `src/data/sentences/*.ts`.
4. Determine if we are successfully meeting those learning objectives. Are there categories with too few sentences? Are there categories lacking variety? How should these objectives be taught?
5. Output a detailed audit to a new artifact named `curriculum_gap_analysis.md`. 
6. Mark this task as ✅ Done when the artifact is committed.

## Resolved

### 2026-03-31 Orchestrator → Educational Publisher
**Status**: ✅ Done
**Task**: Update Grammar Guides for FLS Terminology
**Branch**: `feature/fls-refactor`

### 2026-03-30 Orchestrator → Data Linguist
**Status**: ✅ Done
**Task**: Your escape-fix work never landed on the remote branch. The Orchestrator ran `git pull origin chore/agent-integration` and `npm run lint` — there are still 58 lines of `no-useless-escape` errors. Your commits are either local-only or on the wrong branch.
**Action Required**:
1. Run `git checkout chore/agent-integration` and `git pull origin chore/agent-integration`
2. Re-apply your `\"` → `"` fixes across all 10 files in `src/data/sentences/`
3. Run `npm run lint` and confirm 0 `no-useless-escape` errors in your files
4. Run `git add . && git commit -m "fix(data): remove useless escape sequences"` 
5. Run `git push origin chore/agent-integration`

### 2026-03-30 Orchestrator → Educational Publisher
**Status**: ✅ Done
**Task**: Your escape-fix work in `src/utils/generateStudySheet.ts` never landed on the remote branch. Your commits are either local-only or on the wrong branch.
**Action Required**:
1. Run `git checkout chore/agent-integration` and `git pull origin chore/agent-integration`
2. Re-apply your `\"` → `"` fix on line 385 of `src/utils/generateStudySheet.ts`
3. Run `npx eslint src/utils/generateStudySheet.ts` and confirm 0 errors
4. Run `git add . && git commit -m "fix(utils): remove useless escape sequences"`
5. Run `git push origin chore/agent-integration`
