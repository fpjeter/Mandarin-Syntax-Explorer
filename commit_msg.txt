refactor: centralize badges, extract GrammarGuide, add sidebar search with keyboard nav

- Add badges.ts: single source of truth for all 8 grammar badge specs (label,
  color, headline, detail, match fn). GrammarNode and BadgeLegend both derive
  from this; adding a badge now requires editing one file only.

- Add GrammarGuide.tsx: shared Framework/This-Sentence tab component, removing
  ~120 lines of duplicated JSX from the desktop Explainer and mobile Guide pane.

- Add categories.ts: SentenceCategory derived from a const array via
  typeof SENTENCE_CATEGORIES[number]. Adding a new category only requires
  editing this one file.

- Fix BadgeLegend chevron direction (ChevronUp when open, ChevronDown when closed).

- Merge two [tree] useEffects in SyntaxTree into one, eliminating a redundant
  render cycle on sentence switch.

- Bump estimateNodeWidth CJK multiplier 24 -> 28 to reduce node overlap at
  display font sizes.

- Add sidebar search/filter: real-time filtering by Chinese, pinyin, or English;
  groups auto-expand on match; keyboard nav with ArrowUp/Down to highlight,
  Enter to select, Escape to clear.
